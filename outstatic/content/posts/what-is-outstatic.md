Hello there,

First of all, I'd like to thank you for being here. The fact that people from all around the world are interested in Outstatic still blows my mind.

My goal with this post is to talk a little bit about the origins of the project and where I see it going. I promise it's going to be quick.

## How it all started

I've always wanted to make writing a part of my life. In my opinion, being able to express yourself eloquently is key to becoming better at whatever you do.

The plan was simple: start a blog and write about my journey as a developer. But that's exactly the problem, I'm a developer. I could've just used one of the hundreds of possible CMS solutions or blogging platforms out there, but no, I had to build my own.

I initially cloned a Next.js + Markdown blog example. The advantages of static websites were clear from the beginning, but pushing Markdown to GitHub felt a bit antiquated. I wanted to be able to log in to my website and just edit content.

A few lines of code later, I had built a tool that looked somewhat decent and thought to myself: ‚Äúperhaps other people might find this useful‚Äù. So I gave the project a name and packaged it to look like a "product". Once it had the basic features I needed, I'd make the GitHub repo public, announce it on a subreddit or two, and then start working on my own blog. Long story short, the library blew up and I am yet to start writing. üòÖ

Together with all the support and compliments also came feature requests, issues, pull requests, and I found myself juggling between my day job, an apartment renovation, answering questions, and fixing bugs for Outstatic. Thankfully, some amazing people were kind enough to contribute with ideas, code and also helping run the community. Big shout out to [@jakobo](https://github.com/jakobo), [@ahaasler](https://github.com/ahaasler), [@DCzajkowski](https://github.com/DCzajkowski) and [everyone else who contributed so far](https://github.com/avitorio/outstatic/graphs/contributors)
